        <p>As soon as I learned how to program, I was writing chrome extensions. This was in 2011, my first year of college and last year in school. Prior to programming, I had my own computer repair service. Typically I would be helping elderly people, and through this I began to care very deeply about easy to use interfaces.</p>
        <p>Now, I'm a very technically minded left-brained individual, so I like to also make things powerful. As I became a better and better developer, my strive for simplicity has only gotten stronger - and it doesn't just apply to technology. However, I'm not perfect. My strive for simplicity may be a very direct and natural development because of my ability to, well, complicate things.</p>
        <p>I'm not an incrementalist. In the name of efficiency, I like to solve large problems or many small ones all at once.</p>
        <p>I have the personality type characterisitic J for Judging, which to the unknowing sounds bad, but it really just means I prefer things to be more organized and planned than not. I'm actually pretty comfortable and good at handling changed plans and doing things on a moments notice. In this scenario, I usually figure out a plan very quickly.</p>
        <p>I am a minimalist, and you may find I like big shadows and highly saturated colors. Regardless of who you are, I'm very apt to do any project under $600, because paperwork is essentially not required. Unless I'm becoming overbooked, for $600 you will get me for 3 whole days</p>
