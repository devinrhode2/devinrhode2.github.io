Work History
JavaScript Developer, Opera • June 2015 - January 2016 (7.5 months)
Worked on 2 teams. First project was a network injected javascript toolbar. Second project is a browser extension for a consumer app. The extension is very simple and only does what extensions can do, it contains no UI and instead communicates with a website front-end built with Ember.js. I also worked on the Node.js backend api, supporting the android and iOS clients.
JavaScript Developer, Amobee • April 2013 - August 2013 (5 months)
Collaborated with C Engineers on a hybrid native/web 3d ad engine. Developed 3d ads for clients, and made critical improvements to the ad language, resulting in faster development and less duplication.

Education
University of Minnesota, Duluth 2010-2011 – Focus: Computer Science, Math
  "I hired Devin to code a chrome extension that had a Facebook SDK integration component, and some non trivial script injection dependencies. Devin powered through the project in record time, and had a good sense for design and usability while doing the trickier coding parts. He is one of the most talented young coders I've ever met."
— Sergey Lossev, client
 "Devin has been a very significant contributor"
— Linda Hass, Opera
  "Devin is a very rare type of person. He is the type of student who doesn't look for the grade in a class, but the experience and being able to take something away from it to apply in life."

classmate
