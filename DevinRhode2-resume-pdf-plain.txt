BIWorldwide: Jan 2019 - Jan 2020: Worked on several apps with BI's Custom CMS, Q360. Incrementally upgraded the CMS from React 15 => 16, Webpack 1 + Gulp => Webpack 2 => Webpack 3 => Create-React-App + Craco (Webpack 4 wrapper). Built node proxy to allow us to connect our local dev server to any backend, allowing us to simulate our code running in production. Mastered git submodules, and npm scripts, but migrated to classic monorepo. Began typescript migration. Created language debug mode to find hardcoded english. Created versioning system for frontend, allowing us to check the console for exactly what version is deployed at that time in that browser and match it back to a git tag.

Built a simple internal app for one of EPAM’s larger clients, Google.
Opera • Jun 2015 - Jan 2016
Originally brought in for a short project for 3 months, was kept on to create a chrome extension for a new consumer app. All UI for extension was contained in a separate ember app, which was effectively a standard mobile site, so extension code rarely/never needed updates. Helped with Node rest api built with express.

Education
University of Minnesota, Duluth 2010-2011 – Focus: Computer Science, Math
  "I hired Devin to code a chrome extension that had a Facebook SDK integration component, and some non trivial script injection dependencies. Devin powered through the project in record time, and had a good sense for design and usability while doing the trickier coding parts. He is one of the most talented young coders I've ever met."
— Sergey Lossev, client
 "Devin has been a very significant contributor"
— Linda Hass, Opera
 "Devin is a very rare type of person. He is the type of student who doesn't look for the grade in a class, but the experience and being able to take something away from it to apply in life."

classmate
