Originally brought in for a short project for 3 months, was kept on to create a chrome extension for a new consumer app. All UI for extension was contained in a separate ember app, which was effectively a standard mobile site, so extension code rarely/never needed updates. Helped with Node rest api built with express.

Education
University of Minnesota, Duluth 2010-2011 – Focus: Computer Science, Math
  "I hired Devin to code a chrome extension that had a Facebook SDK integration component, and some non trivial script injection dependencies. Devin powered through the project in record time, and had a good sense for design and usability while doing the trickier coding parts. He is one of the most talented young coders I've ever met."
— Sergey Lossev, client
 "Devin has been a very significant contributor"
— Linda Hass, Opera
 "Devin is a very rare type of person. He is the type of student who doesn't look for the grade in a class, but the experience and being able to take something away from it to apply in life."
— Ehsan Angadjivand,
classmate
