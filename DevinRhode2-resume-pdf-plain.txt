Work History
JavaScript Developer, EPAM • Apr 2016 - Jun 2016 (3 mos) Built a simple internal app for one of EPAM’s larger clients, Google.
JavaScript Developer, Opera • Jun 2015 - Jan 2016 (8 mos)
My first project was a network injected javascript toolbar. Second project was a browser extension for a consumer app. I made a very simple mobile website with Ember.js to contain all the ui for the extension, so extension updates didn’t need to be published as often. I also helped with the Node.js backend api, supporting the android and iOS clients.
JavaScript Developer, Amobee • Apr 2013 - Aug 2013 (5 mos)
Collaborated with C Engineers on a hybrid native/web 3d ad engine. Developed 3d ads for clients, and made critical improvements to the ad language, resulting in faster development and less duplication.

Education
University of Minnesota, Duluth 2010-2011 – Focus: Computer Science, Math
  "I hired Devin to code a chrome extension that had a Facebook SDK integration component, and some non trivial script injection dependencies. Devin powered through the project in record time, and had a good sense for design and usability while doing the trickier coding parts. He is one of the most talented young coders I've ever met."
— Sergey Lossev, client
 "Devin has been a very significant contributor"
— Linda Hass, Opera
  "Devin is a very rare type of person. He is the type of student who doesn't look for the grade in a class, but the experience and being able to take something away from it to apply in life."

classmate
