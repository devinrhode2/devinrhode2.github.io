Work History
Alliance Laundry Systems (RHT) • Nov 2017 - Oct 2018
Worked on ember-frontend of laundromat management app "Speed Queen Insights", with emphasis on the washer/dryer programming interface re-write in web. One notable contribution I made was setting up an error dashboard.
EPAM • Apr 2016 - Jun 2016
Built a simple internal app for one of EPAM’s larger clients, Google.
Opera • Jun 2015 - Jan 2016
Initially hired to help with toolbar, after which I was kept on to build a browser extension for a consumer app. All UI was contained in a separate ember app, so extension code rarely needs updates. I also helped with the Node.js backend api.
Amobee • Apr 2013 - Aug 2013
Worked with C Engineers on a hybrid native/web 3D ad engine, focusing on web. Developed 3D ads for clients, and made critical improvements to the ad language, resulting in faster development and less code duplication.

Education
  "I hired Devin to code a chrome extension that had a Facebook SDK integration component, and some non trivial script injection dependencies. Devin powered through the project in record time, and had a good sense for design and usability while doing the trickier coding parts. He is one of the most talented young coders I've ever met."
— Sergey Lossev, client
 "Devin has been a very significant contributor"
— Linda Hass, Opera
 "Devin is a very rare type of person. He is the type of student who doesn't look for the grade in a class, but the experience and being able to take something away from it to apply in life."

classmate
  University of Minnesota, Duluth 2010-2011 – Focus: Computer Science, Math
